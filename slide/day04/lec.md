Introduction to REST
====================

##Key drivers of REST
 - Heterogeneous Interoperability

    Ability to integrate with systems implemented in different programming languages and platforms. 

 - Devices

    Standard to communicate w/ difference devices

 - Cloud

    Moving from private server to cloud

`It is critical to build a scalable architecture in order to take advantage of a scalable infra`

##Properties of REST
 - Heterogeny
 - Scalability
 - Evolability
 - Visibility
 - Reliability
 - Efficiency
 - Performance
 - Manageability

##Richardson Maturity Model
 - Level 0

   Remote Interaction Mechanism - design how to communicate w/ service

 - Level 1

   Individual resources - describe each step in detail

 - Level 2

   Interaction through HTTP - Map w/ HTTP Verb

 - Level 3

   Self-Document - detail response message

##REST Constraints
 - **Client - server**
 - **Stateless**
 - **Caching**
 - Uniform Interface
 - Layered system
 - Code on demand
